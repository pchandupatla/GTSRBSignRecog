# GTSRBSignRecog
Convolutional Neural Net built to identify German Traffic Signs. Built using PyTorch library. The completed model is aviailable in GTSRB_Model.pth. After constructing and training the net, gradient visualization was
performed to determine network areas of interest in sample images. These visualizations are contained within the Experiment One Folder. CS342_Paper.pdf describes the development, training, and
experimentation with the model.
